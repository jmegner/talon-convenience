# talon-convenience

This repo is for scripts and other files to make certain talon-related tasks
more convenient.
Ex: scripts that make it easy to switch between my personal talon config and the
community talon config.

This repo should be placed directly under talon's `user` folder.

See https://jacobegner.wordpress.com/2023/06/21/talon-voice-and-extras-setup-notes/
